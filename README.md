# Ensemble-MUS

Ensemble generation for a Made-Up Sensor from a flat truth image and a simple error structure: relative error at pixel level and relative error at scanline level. The script gens_v0.py generates the ensemble with random errors at pixel and scanline level for which the relative standard uncertainty is a constant. 

The other scripts aim the same for a more complex error structure and are organised in modules with classes and/or functions offering a similar functionality.
