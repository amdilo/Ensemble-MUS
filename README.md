# Ensemble-MUS

Ensemble generation for a Made-Up Sensor from a flat truth image and a simple error structure: relative error at pixel level and relative error at scanline level. The script gens_v0.py generates the ensemble with random errors at pixel and scanline level for which the relative standard uncertainty is a constant. 

The other scripts perform the same for a more complex error structure and are organised in modules. The error structure consists of a constant uncertainty values for counts and calibration target temperature.
